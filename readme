Notes:

- rx vlc signals will be generated and processed online, and then deleted. Otherwise the simulator requires too much memory.
- all scenarios consider 1 ego, 1 target vehicle, no obstructions in between
- all scenarios consider collision avoidance and platooning, so road between target and ego is assumed to be 2D
