- the qrx configuration is used for all methods (methods that require 1 pd take an average over qrx cells)

- both lambertian and non-lambertian ("real") light patterns are supported, they have different formats, check the two examples 
  (the LbSedan one is a real pattern) 

- all tx units are assumed to be point sources (vs extended), so their angular radiation patterns are 
  assumed to be valid for all distances, see related assumption on the article in Section II

- the https://github.com/mjhoptics/ray-optics library is used for obtaining qrx patterns with different lenses

- we wrote custom numerical integrators to compute real headlight patterns, see notebooks under utilities/ for more info
