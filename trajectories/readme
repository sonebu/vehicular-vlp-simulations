- sampling rate is 1000 Hz by default.

- we only keep relative trajectories and assume target vehicle is leading the ego vehicle, i.e., tail lights are transmitters.
  since we're not doing any dynamic simulation, x/y/hdg is enough from a reference point on the vehicles.
  therefore, only the following variables are saved for each trajectory: x_RL, x_RR, y_RL, y_RR, hdg. 

- "recorded_INTERACTION_collisionthreat.npz" is a filtered and resampled version of an excerpt from the recorded scenario "DR_DEU_Merging_MT" from the INTERACTION dataset:
  https://github.com/interaction-dataset/interaction-dataset
  https://github.com/interaction-dataset/interaction-dataset_selected_scenarios_list/tree/main/collision_threats

  in this excerpt, 2 vehicles experience a collision threat on a highway merging lane. 
  we provide the full filtering and resampling procedure in a notebook under utilities/, but we cannot provide the .npz file here due to distribution limitations. 
  contact the INTERACTION team for access to the dataset, and use the provided notebook for generating "recorded_INTERACTION_collisionthreat.npz" for use in the simulations.

  to understand what the trajectory looks like, see the video at utilities/recorded_collisionthreat_veh24veh25.avi , vehicles 24 and 25 are the ones that are used in simulation. 

- "generated_*.npz" trajectories are from the v1 MATLAB repo:
