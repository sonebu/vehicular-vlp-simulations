# The inaccuracies caused by Global Positioning System (GPS), and the inefficiencies or insufficient rates caused by radar or lidar-based approaches due to cost, complexity and interference in collision avoidance and platooning applications (CAaP) increased the contributions based on vehicular visible light positioning (VVLP) using visible light communication (VLC) signals from LED head/tail lights to the literature. Such applications require cm-level accuracy in kHz rates that can be satisfied with approaches based on signal parameters such as Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA), Angle of Arrival (AoA), Phase Difference of Arrival (PDoA), and Round-trip Time of Arrival (RToA). However, a fair theoretical and simulated comparison between these approaches is not available as they assume different system models and consider limiting conditions. In this project, we have focused on the analysis and comparison of the theoretical and simulated performances of such state-of-the-art vehicular VLP methods. Theoretical analyses rely on the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) derivations for the subject methods.
